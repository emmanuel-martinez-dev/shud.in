# Shu Ding

I am a designer and developer based in Berlin. My interests span a broad spectrum of subjects, encompassing web development, creative coding, game design, and human-computer interaction.

Since high school, Iâ€™ve spent years on algorithm competitions, freelance web design and development. In 2017, I earned my BSc degree in Computer Science from Fudan University in Shanghai, and joined as a software engineer at Microsoft. In 2018, I joined [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to help build the next generation of web development tools.
