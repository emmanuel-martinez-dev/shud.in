# Shu Ding

Hey! I am a designer and developer residing in Berlin, currently building [v0](https://v0.dev), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and other projects at [Vercel](https://vercel.com). My interests span a broad spectrum of subjects, encompassing web development, creative coding, game design, and human-computer interaction.

Since high school, I've spent years on algorithm competitions, freelance web design & development, and worked as a software engineer at Microsoft. In 2017, I earned my BSc degree in Computer Science from Fudan University. In 2018, I joined Vercel to help build the next generation of web development tools.
