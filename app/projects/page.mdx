# Projects

I’ve worked on a variety of projects over the years. Here are a few of my favorites:

<details>
<summary>Next.js</summary>

I actively work as a core maintainer of Next.js since 2020. I also led the development of Streaming SSR, Edge SSR, Server Components, and Server Actions in Next.js, and other architectural changes.

## Vercel v0

I co-created v0 with @jaredpalmer, @shadcn and @max_leiter in 2023, designed the application architecture and multiple parts of the core AI.

## Vercel AI SDK

Designed the client side hook APIs of the SDK, and implemented the function calling and data APIs together with @max_leiter. I also implemented the playground and the documentation website together with @jaredpalmer and @max_leiter.

## SWR

Co-created SWR with @rauchg as the first hook-based, stale-while-revalidate data fetching library in 2019, and led its development for 4 years.

## Nextra

I created Nextra and its blog and docs themes in 2020, led the development of Nextra v2 in 2022.

## Satori

I created Satori in 2021, and still maintain it today with some active contributors.

## Mak

I created Mak in 2015. It has 3k+ stable monthly active users for the last 5 years with almost zero marketing effort, which is what I’m most proud of.

## COBE

The smallest (5kB) 3d globe implementation for the web, with a focus on performance and design.

## React Wrap Balancer

I created this library in 2022, and it got popular in the React community and was ported to other languages like Vue and Svelte. I believe this helped pushing the development of CSS standard `text-wrap: balance` forward (which is now supported in Chrome).

## Next View Transitions

I created this library

## Y86

I created this web-based Y86 simulator in 2015, my second year at university. It helped thousands of students learn CPU architecture in the past years, and has been listed as a recommended resource by University of Maryland, James Madison University.

## Metaballs

An interactive WebGL demo that I created as a generative art experiment. It also has a Metal port that runs on macOS as a screensaver.

## Tilg

An experimental utility hook that I created in 2022, to help our team debugging UI code easier.

## Next.js Website (2018)

The original Next.js website design and implementation in 2018.
