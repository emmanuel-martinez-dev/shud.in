# Projects

I believe in the power of building tools and libraries that empower developers to create amazing things. Here are some of my notable contributions over the years:

import { Nextjs, V0, SWR, Nextra, AISDK, Satori, COBE, ReactWrapBalancer, NextViewTransitions, Plaintext } from '@/components/project-logos'

## [<Nextjs height={14} />](https://nextjs.org 'Next.js')

I’ve been contributing to Next.js as a core maintainer since 2020. I led the development of Streaming SSR, Edge Runtime, React Server Components, Server Actions and other major architectural changes in Next.js.

## [<V0 height={14}/>](https://v0.dev 'Vercel v0')

I co-created [v0](https://v0.dev) with [Jared Palmer](https://jaredpalmer.com), [Max Leiter](https://maxleiter.com), and [shadcn](https://shadcn.com/) in 2023. I helped design the application architecture and implemented multiple parts of the core AI and streaming pipeline.

## [<AISDK height={18}/>](https://github.com/vercel/ai 'Vercel AI SDK')

I designed the initial version of client-side hook APIs, implemented function calling, RSC and data APIs. I also developed the initial AI playground and documentation site.

## [<SWR height={13}/>](https://swr.vercel.app 'SWR')

I created [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) with [Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com) in 2019 as the first hook-based, stale-while-revalidate data fetching library. Led its development for 4 years.

[Paco Coursey](https://paco.me) designed the delightful SWR logo.

## [<Nextra height={14}/>](https://nextra.site 'Nextra')

I created Nextra in 2020 and led the development of Nextra v2 in 2022. It is one of the most popular Next.js based documentation solutions.

## [<Satori height={18}/>](https://github.com/vercel/satori 'Satori')

Satori is the first CSS-to-SVG render engine that does not rely on a browser environment. I created Satori in 2021 for Vercel’s [OG Image Generation](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-vercel-og-image-generation-fast-dynamic-social-card-images) project.

Given the good balance between size, performance and compatibility, Satori now becomes a semi-standard way of generating social cards in many popular Web frameworks such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/image-response), [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/modules/og-image), [SvelteKit](https://github.com/etherCorps/sveltekit-og), and others.

## [<COBE height={18}/>](https://github.com/shuding/cobe 'COBE')

COBE is maybe the smallest (5kB) web 3D globe implementation, with a clean design. I made it in 2021 to optimize Vercel’s homepage performance by then ([story](https://twitter.com/shuding_/status/1475916082875666441)).

## [<ReactWrapBalancer height={18} />](https://react-wrap-balancer.vercel.app 'React Wrap Balancer')

Created this popular library in 2022, which was later ported to Vue and Svelte. I believe this library helped pushing forward the development of the CSS standard `text-wrap: balance`.

## [<NextViewTransitions height={18}/>](https://github.com/shuding/next-view-transitions 'Next View Transitions')

Created this library to enhance transitions in Next.js applications.

I also make fun projects casually:

## [<Plaintext title="Y86 CPU Simulator"/>](https://y86.js.org 'Y86 Simulator')

Developed this web-based Y86 simulator in 2015, helping thousands of students learn CPU architecture. Recognized as a recommended resource by multiple universities.

## [<Plaintext title="Metaballs"/>](https://metaballs.vercel.app 'Metaballs')

Created an interactive WebGL demo as a generative art experiment, with a Metal port for macOS screensavers.

## [<Plaintext title="Mak Ink"/>](https://inns.studio/mak 'Mak')

Made for personal use in 2015. Achieved 3k+ monthly active users for 5+ years with zero marketing.

## [<Plaintext title="Frosted Glass"/>](https://frosted-glass.vercel.app 'Frosted Glass')

Depth-based blur in CSS.

## [<Plaintext title="Composable SVG Shaders"/>](https://svg-shaders.vercel.app 'Composable SVG Shaders')

Shaders for regular HTML elements.
